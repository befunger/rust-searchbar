A tool for custom commands in my Firefox URL bar, implemented with Rust.
Commands are used to direct search to specific websites, such as "maps Stockholm" redirecting the search for "Stockholm" to Google Maps.

Currently implemented commands:
git     - github
maps   - Google Maps
yt     - Youtube
Defaults to standard Google Search
